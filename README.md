## Overview
## **PLEASE ALLOW NO MORE THAN 30 MINUTES PER PROBLEM**

This assessment consists of multiple problems, each contained in its own numbered folder (e.g., `1/`, `2/`).  
Each folder includes the following files:

`constraints.md` – Contains any constraints or special considerations for the problem.

`problem.md` – Describes the problem statement and expected inputs/outputs.

`problem.py` – The file where you will write your solution.

`test.py` – Contains test cases to validate your solution.

## Viewing Markdown Files

To view Markdown files properly in VS Code, open the file and press:
- Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux)
- Cmd + Shift + V (Mac)

## How to Complete the Assessment

1. Read the Problem Statement

- Open `problem.md` inside the corresponding folder to understand the problem requirements.
- Check `constraints.md` for any constraints or additional rules.

2. Implement Your Solution

- Write your solution inside `problem.py`.
- Give your time and space complexity analysis in the comments.
- If you write any notes or pseudocode, please leave those as comments in `problem.py` so that I can see your problem solving approach.

3. Run the Tests

- Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the problem. For example, if working on problem 1: `cd 1`

- Run the test cases using Python’s built-in unittest module: `python3 -m unittest test.py`

If tests pass, your solution is likely correct, though there are hidden test cases with edge cases you may have to take into account of as well. If any tests fail, debug and update problem.py accordingly.

## Notes
- Ensure you do not modify test.py unless instructed.
- Follow best coding practices and write clean, readable code.
- If you encounter issues, double-check the problem statement and constraints.

Remember, this is just to see how you tackle problems—no pressure!
